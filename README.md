AeroGear Cordova Kitchensink Quickstart (WORK IN PROGRESS)
=======================================
Author: Kris Borchers

Summary
-------
This project serves as an example of AeroGear's [kitchensink quickstart](http://www.github.com/aerogear/as-quickstarts/tree/master/kitchensink-html5-mobile),
converted to an [Apache Cordova](http://incubator.apache.org/cordova/) based, hybrid application. What does all of that
mean? Basically, this takes our [POH5](https://community.jboss.org/wiki/POH5PlainOldHTML5Applications) /
[jQuery Mobile](http://www.jquerymobile.com) based web app and converts it to a native app for both iOS and
Android. Currently, these apps will need to be built separately but in the future, we hope to provide a single build
step for all supported mobile OS types.
